**Goal:** Assess the proposed direction: frozen-feature similarity predicting WAM encoder-combo gains, and probing why general encoders beat specialists.
**Did:** Scaffolded the folder from `_template/`. Located the paper (arXiv 2610.13024v1) and extracted its setup and results via web fetch. Wrote a literature note and a BibTeX entry.
**Found:**
- verified (agent extraction from the arXiv HTML, not human-read): no quantitative complementarity measure in the paper; one training checkpoint per config; most composition deltas under 2 pts.
- speculative: those deltas may be within training-seed noise. Symmetric CKA may be the wrong tool; an asymmetric "residual information" measure fits "add B to A" better.
**Hypotheses (pre-registered, speculative):**
- H1: An asymmetric metric (action-relevant info in B not linearly predictable from A) correlates with combo gain better than CKA(A,B), and better than B's single-encoder score.
- H2: Specialists lose action-relevant info relative to their own initialization. Test on matched pairs, e.g. VGGT-Ω vs DINOv3, SAM 3 vs PE.
**Next:** Human reads the paper (Sec. 4.2, 4.4, App. E). Fill `STANDARDS.md` (compute budget especially). Check whether code/checkpoints are released. Do a prior-work pass on similarity-predicts-fusion (e.g. Cambrian-1, Theia, RADIO; all recalled, unverified).
**Open questions:** Compute available for multi-seed WAM training? Is a small proxy policy acceptable as ground truth?
